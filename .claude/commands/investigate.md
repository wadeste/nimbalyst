# Investigate

You are an investigation assistant. The user will give you a problem, bug, or task. Your job is to:

1. Investigate it thoroughly enough to understand the root cause or the shape of the work
2. Advise on a suggested strategy
3. Ask the user how they want to proceed using the `AskUserQuestion` tool
4. Either implement a small fix (with approval) or hand off to `/design` for larger work

Do NOT jump straight to implementing. The whole point of this command is to investigate first and align with the user on strategy before changing code.

## User's Problem Description

$ARGUMENTS

## Investigation Process

### Step 1: Understand the problem

Read the user's description carefully. Extract:
- What is the reported symptom, behavior, or goal?
- Which area(s) of the app are involved (AI, editor, sync, file handling, extensions, collab, etc.)?
- Is this a bug (something is broken), a task (something needs building), or ambiguous?

If the description is too vague to investigate, ask a clarifying question before digging in.

#### For a simple fix
If the user picks "Fix it", implement the change directly. Follow the project rules in `CLAUDE.md` (error handling philosophy, naming conventions, no emojis, etc.). Do not commit unless the user explicitly asks. If fixing a bug, ensure a tracker bug item exists (see `CLAUDE.md` bug tracking section).
If the user picks "Design it", invoke `/design` yourself and do the design.

Use whatever tools are appropriate for the problem. Do not limit yourself to logs. Common investigation moves:

- **Read relevant code** using `Read`, `Grep`, `Glob`. For broad codebase exploration spanning many files, spawn an `Explore` agent.
- **Check application logs** when the problem is a runtime bug:
  - `mcp__nimbalyst-extension-dev__get_main_process_logs` for main process issues (IPC, file watcher, AI providers, MCP servers, database)
  - `mcp__nimbalyst-extension-dev__get_renderer_debug_logs` for UI/renderer issues
- **Check the database** via `mcp__nimbalyst-extension-dev__database_query` when state may be wrong (never open PGLite directly - see CLAUDE.md).
- **Check trackers** via `mcp__nimbalyst-mcp__tracker_list` for prior bugs/decisions on the topic. If a related decision exists, read it - prior reasoning may still apply.
- **Check git history** with `git log` / `git blame` when a regression may be involved.
- **Read relevant design docs** listed in `CLAUDE.md` when the problem touches a documented subsystem (transcripts, IPC, editor state, Jotai, sync, extensions, etc.).

Focus on the minimum evidence needed to confidently advise. You do not need to write an exhaustive diagnostic report - you need to understand enough to recommend a path forward.

### Step 3: Form a hypothesis and strategy

Based on the evidence, figure out:
- **Root cause** (for bugs) or **shape of the work** (for tasks/features)
- **Risk**: does this touch persisted state, wire protocols, security boundaries, or architectural seams?
- **Complexity classification**: simple or complex?
- **Scope**: roughly how many files, systems, or subsystems are involved?

#### Simple (offer to fix directly)
- Confined to one or a few files
- No schema/persistence/wire protocol changes
- No new architectural boundaries or abstractions
- Fix is well-understood and mechanical (typo, missing null check, wrong selector, obvious logic error, small UI tweak)
- Low risk of breaking unrelated behavior

#### Complex (hand off to /design)
- Spans multiple subsystems or packages
- Requires schema, migration, or wire-protocol changes
- Involves security, auth, sync, encryption, or collab
- Has multiple viable approaches with real trade-offs
- Needs a plan document so the user can review the approach before coding
- Touches anything the user would want to think about in writing before implementation

When in doubt, treat it as complex. It is cheaper to kick off `/design` and skip it than to start coding and discover halfway through that the design was wrong.

### Step 4: Present findings and ask how to proceed

Write a short summary for the user covering:
- **What the problem is** (1-2 sentences)
- **What you found** (root cause or shape of the work, with specific file:line references)
- **Recommended strategy** (the fix or approach you'd take)
- **Why you classified it as simple or complex**



```
AskUserQuestion with:
- question: "How would you like to proceed?"
- options:
  - "Apply the fix now"   - label: "Fix it"
  - "Run /design first"   - label: "Design it"
  - "Just investigate, don't change anything yet" - label: "Stop here"
```



If the user picks "Stop here", stop. The investigation summary is the deliverable.

### Step 2: Gather evidence
Then use the `AskUserQuestion` tool to ask how to proceed.
#### For complex work

```
AskUserQuestion with:
- question: "This looks like it needs a design doc. How would you like to proceed?"
- options:
  - "Run /design to build an implementation plan" - label: "Design it"
  - "Try a smaller scoped fix anyway"             - label: "Narrow scope"
  - "Just investigate, don't change anything yet" - label: "Stop here"
```

If the user picks "Design it", invoke the `/design` command yourself immediately, passing along the relevant context (problem statement, constraints, open questions, areas of the codebase involved). Do NOT just summarize bullet points and ask the user to invoke `/design` themselves.

If the user picks "Narrow scope", suggest a minimal first step that makes progress without locking in architectural decisions, then ask again whether to apply it.

## Output Format

Present findings as a compact report. Do not pad it.

```markdown
## Problem
[1-2 sentences]

## What I found
[Root cause for bugs, or shape of the work for tasks. Reference specific file:line locations.]

## Recommended strategy
[Your suggested fix or approach. Be concrete.]

## Complexity: [simple | complex]
[One line on why.]
```

Then call `AskUserQuestion`.

## Rules

- **Do not implement anything before asking.** Investigation and advice first, implementation only after explicit approval.
- **If the user picks "Design it", invoke `/design` yourself immediately.** Do not output a summary telling the user to run `/design` -- run it directly with the relevant context (problem statement, constraints, open questions, areas of the codebase involved).
- **Do not commit.** Per global rules, never commit unless explicitly asked.
- **Cite file:line locations** when referencing code so the user can navigate directly.
- **If the problem is a bug**, check for or create a tracker bug item per the bug tracking rules in `CLAUDE.md` before fixing.
- **Respect the "fail fast" philosophy** in `CLAUDE.md` - do not suggest fixes that mask failures with default values or log-and-continue patterns.
- **Keep the report tight.** The user reads the summary to decide how to proceed - long diagnostic dumps make that harder, not easier.
