# /design Command

Create a new plan document for tracking work.

## Overview

Plans are structured markdown documents with YAML frontmatter that track features, initiatives, projects, and other work.

## File Location and Naming

**Location**: `nimbalyst-local/plans/[descriptive-name].md`

**Naming conventions**:
- Use kebab-case: `user-authentication-system.md`, `marketing-campaign-q4.md`
- Be descriptive: The filename should clearly indicate what the plan is about

## Required YAML Frontmatter

```yaml
---
planStatus:
  planId: plan-[unique-identifier]
  title: [Plan Title]
  status: draft
  planType: feature
  priority: medium
  owner: [your-name]
  stakeholders: []
  tags: []
  created: "YYYY-MM-DD"
  updated: "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.sssZ"
  progress: 0
---
```

## Status Values

- `draft`: Initial planning phase
- `ready-for-development`: Approved and ready to start
- `in-development`: Currently being worked on
- `in-review`: Implementation complete, pending review
- `completed`: Successfully completed
- `rejected`: Plan has been rejected or cancelled
- `blocked`: Progress blocked by dependencies

## Plan Types

Common plan types:
- `feature`: New feature development
- `bug-fix`: Bug fix or issue resolution
- `refactor`: Code refactoring/improvement
- `system-design`: Architecture/design work
- `research`: Research/investigation task
- `initiative`: Large multi-feature effort
- `improvement`: Enhancement to existing feature

## Usage

When the user types `/design [description]`:

1. Research the codebase to understand the relevant code, architecture, and constraints
2. Extract key information from the description
3. Generate unique `planId` from description (kebab-case)
4. Choose appropriate `planType` based on description
5. Set `created` to today's date, `updated` to current timestamp
6. Create file in `nimbalyst-local/plans/` with proper frontmatter
7. Include relevant sections based on plan type

## Refining the Design with the User

After writing the initial plan document, use the `AskUserQuestion` tool to ask the user about any open design questions, ambiguities, or trade-offs you identified during research. This is critical for producing a high-quality design that reflects the user's intent.

**When to ask:**
- There are multiple valid approaches and the right choice depends on user preference
- Requirements are ambiguous or underspecified
- You identified trade-offs (performance vs simplicity, scope vs timeline, etc.)
- The design touches areas where the user may have strong opinions (UI layout, API shape, data model)

**How to ask:**
- Use `AskUserQuestion` with concrete options, not open-ended questions
- Frame each option with a brief description of its trade-offs
- Group related questions together (up to 4 per call)
- After receiving answers, update the plan document to reflect the user's decisions

## Visual Mockups

When a plan involves UI components, screens, or visual design, use the `/mockup` command in a sub-agent to create mockups. This keeps visual design work separate from planning.

**When to create a mockup:**
- Planning new UI components or screens
- Designing layout and structure
- Changes that need visual feedback before implementation

**When NOT to create a mockup:**
- Backend-only changes
- Refactoring that doesn't change UI
- Bug fixes with obvious solutions
- Infrastructure or configuration changes
- Minor and well-described UI changes where there are no remaining design choices

If a visual mockup would help communicate the plan, tell the user you'll use `/mockup` to create one, and do so after completing the plan document.
Make sure the plan document references and links the mockup file using the mockup image syntax, and use your Capture Mockup Screenshot tool to view it once the sub-agent completes and verify that it conforms to the plan.

**Mockup image syntax:**
```markdown
![Description](screenshot.png){mockup:path/to/mockup.mockup.html}
```

With optional size:
```markdown
![Description](screenshot.png){mockup:path/to/mockup.mockup.html}{800x600}
```

## Best Practices

- Keep plans focused on a single objective
- Update progress regularly as work proceeds
- Use tags to categorize related plans
- Add stakeholders who need visibility
- Set realistic due dates when applicable
